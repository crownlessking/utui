# UTUI Help Page

UTUI stands for "unit test user interface".  
As of now, it is a simple interace to get PHPUnit outputs in the browser. Currently, this interface was designed to works with [**`composer`**](https://getcomposer.org/) PHP projects. This means,  

*   Your project's root folder must contain a `composer.json` file.
*   Your project's `vendor/autoload.php` must be properly configured.
*   You're using [**`phpunit`**](https://phpunit.de/) testing framework.

However, if you have your own `autoload.php` file located in `/vendor` from your project's root folder or, you have a `bootstrap` file located in your test folder and provided that you're also using `phpunit`, the interface should still work as it should.

## Setup

To use UTUI, you first need to download the `PHAR` version of `phpunit`. Once that is done, rename the file to `phpunit`, with no extension. Then paste it in the root folder of UTUI, next to the `index.php` file.

**Note:** This interface was implemented using `phpunit.phar version 7.3.x`.

### Troubleshooting

For <cod>PHP</cod> projects, <cod>PHP-CLI</cod> is required. Make sure it is installed properly by doing `php -v` from the command line. the `PHP` version should get printed. If not, download and install it.  
Permission is the only issue I ran into when developing this interface.  
Make sure that `PHP` has enough permission to create folders and files. The app will create ONLY one folder called `tmp` in UTUI root folder and two files: `bootstrap.php` and `filesList.xml`.  
If PHP cannot create that folder and these files, the interface will NOT work.  
I personally solved this problem by changing the group settings (ownership) of UTUI project folder and all files within.  
Since I am on Linux, I did so using the following command:  

`chown -R :www-data utui`  

When I changed the group to `www-data` the problem was gone. Naturally, PHP should be in the www-data group. If you still get permission issues, try deleting the `tmp` folder.

### Troubleshooting GitHub Downloads

After downloading UTUI from GitHub, the permissions will be all messed up.  
After unzipped the UTUI folder, open a terminal and run the following command on the newly unzipped folder:  

`sudo chown -R :www-data phpunit-ui-master`  

and then  

`chmod -R a+rX phpunit-ui-master`  

and finally,  

`chmod -R g+w phpunit-ui-master`  

This should give PHP enough permission to create folders.

## How to Use

Click on the ![](./images/help/Selection_014.png) icon on the navigation bar to bring up the unit-test interface. Once you're on the uni-test interface, you must select the project on which you want to conduct tests.

### Select Your Project's Root Folder

To do that, click on ![](./images/help/Selection_015.png) to enter the path to your project's root folder.

Once you have entered your project's root folder path and it is correct, if your PHP test files are located the `tests` folder, they will be automatically loaded once you have clicked the ![](./images/help/Selection_016.png) button. If they are not located in the `tests` folder, you can use the `textfield` to specify your custom folder. e.g.  

![](./images/help/Selection_018.png)

### Load Test Files

Once your project's root and tests folder are correct, after clicking the ![](./images/help/Selection_016.png) button, all your PHP test files, including those located in sub-folders will populate the files list pane.

e.g.  
![](./images/help/Selection_019.png)

### Running Tests

Once the test files are loaded, click on the ![](./images/help/Selection_020.png) button to run unit tests.

To test a single file, uncheck all files by clicking the blank square, without a check mark: ![](./images/help/Selection_021.png) and check only the file you want to test.  
![](./images/help/Selection_022.png)  
Then click on the ![](./images/help/Selection_020.png) button.

Results are displayed on the left in the output pane. Notice, these are phpunit console outputs:

### Adding Bootstrap File(s)

To boostrap a file, a file which needs to run before the test begins, it must first be located in your project test folder. It won't be visible since its not a test file. To view other files in your project directory, in the filter textfield, type "`/`" without the quotes.

![](./images/help/Selection_025.png)

The files will be grey-out and you will not be able to check them like a test file. But if the file is a PHP file, you will be able to bootstrap it. e.g.

![](./images/help/Selection_024.png)

If you hover the file name with your mouse pointer, a "cogs" icon will appear and you'll be able to click on it.

Once you do that, the `bootstrap.php` file will now be bootstrapped when you click the ![](./images/help/Selection_020.png) to run your test.
